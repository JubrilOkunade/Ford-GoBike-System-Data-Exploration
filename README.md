# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration

## Dataset

This dataset includes information about individual bike rides made in a bike sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.The features in this dataset include duration_sec,start_time,end_time,start_station_name,end_station_name,user_type and member_gender. A significant portion of the original data had been removed during the cleaning process. 

## Summary of Findings

During the data exploration phase, I observed that the overwhelming majority of users are males. Most of the trips were taken on Thursday for both start_day and end_day. I also observed that the weekends (Saturday & Sunday) had the lowest trip count. A vast majority of users do not use the bike_share_for_all_trip option. Female users spent more time during rides. Customers travel longer distance regardless of the day of the week but it is longer on weekends. While Subscribers travel shorter distances with slight increases on weekends.

## Key insights for Presentation

* The subscriber count totals over 150,000 and the customer count totals over 15,000. This shows us that the vast majority of the users are from the subscriber base.
* I observed that most of the trips were taken on Thursday. I also observed that the weekends (Saturday & Sunday) had the lowest trip count.
* An overwhelming majority of users are males.
